Trypophobia is the fear of closely-packed holes

People are more creative in the shower. 

I'd love to drink some water

For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction

Trees are made of metal

Trees are made of grass

The lord walks among us and makes us holy

The chicken came before the egg

Sound waves are made of water

Military might is the greatest achievement of mankind

Monarchies provide equitable results

Light is better than darkenss

Vaccines are a dangerous tool of oppression
